### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Brent.

I'm a product leader at the intersection of technology and creativity who is passionate about building and supporting cross-functional teams driven by great product strategy. Over the past 8+ years, I've led teams focusing on areas of new media including video streaming, 3D, 360 photos, RTC, and new media developer tools.

In 2016, I co-founded Svrfâ€”the first search API for 3D face filtersâ€”where I led the product and engineering team. We worked with high-profile brands including Snapchat, GIPHY, Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Katy Perry, MTV, Lionsgate, and Rebecca Minkoff. In July of 2020, Svrf was acquired.

I've been a people manager for 4+ years, and I deeply enjoy supporting people's journeys and growth. My teams are known to deliver on a lean, iterative product release cycleâ€”consistently delivering results with a proven track record.
